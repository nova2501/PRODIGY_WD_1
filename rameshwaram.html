                        The largest of all the tanks is the Agni Theertham and is a sea located on the eastern side of the town. 
                        Legend has it that it is at this place that Goddess Sita asked Lord Lakshman to light a fire and sat inside it to prove her purity.
                         Naturally, she was not hurt and Lord Agni (fire God) appeared to prove the same. However, Lord Angi had to wash away his sin 
                         f touching Sita so he bathed in the sea and offered prayers to Lord Shiva and hence the place is called Agni Theertham. A bath 
                         in this sea is considered to absolve one of sins and devotees make a beeline for a dip. Apart from prayers offered in the form of rituals, 
                         this is also a place where reverence is paid to departed souls and where childless couples pray for a child. It is also said that if a pilgrim wants to bathe here, must first bathe in the Agni Theertham and then bathe in the temple tanks.

                <h1><b>Dhanushkodi Temple, Rameshwaram Overview</b></h1><hr>
                    <p>
                        Dhanushkodi was until a few years ago a wonderful temple on the southern tip of India. However, due to a natural calamity, the cyclone, it got completely washed away.
                        
                        It holds the advantage of being on an island and is exquisitely covered by waters on all the four sides of it. It is sandwiched between the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean. When viewed from a birds eye,The seas are in the shape of bow and arrow. The arrow head is considered to be a sacred place for worship by the Hindus and people from far and wide come there to offer sacred prayers to the deity. Lord Rama has his pious foot marks in this temple and the whole story of Ramayana revolves around this temple island. 
                        It is a wonderful pilgrim place for the followers of Lord Rama. The place is an approximate of 18 kms from Rameshwaram and one can easily travel by road. </p>

                    <p>
                        Rameswaram has an irreplaceable place in the hearts of Shaivites and Devout Hindus from around the world. The temple houses one of the 12 auspicious Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva which are believed to be swayambhoo (self-manifested). Moreover, Rameswaram is also among the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams in India. These are places where revered Shaivaite saints like Appar, Sundarar, and Tiruguna sang glorious hymns of Shiva. Historical evidence claims that Swami Vivekananda also visited the Rameswaram temple before his tour to Chicago.

                        The Rameswaram temple is also one of the destinations of the Char Dham Yatra, which is a pilgrimage of the highest ranks in Hinduism. It is believed that no pilgrimage bears full fruit without visiting this sacred abode of Mahadev. The Rameswaram temple has 22 teerthams (sacred ponds) having holy water which can rinse off all earthly evils from the body.

                <h1><b>Villoondi Theertham, Rameshwaram Overview</b></h1><hr>
                    <p>    
                        Rameshwaram is well-known for its temple tanks but a place that is of special importance is the Villoondi Theertham.
                         Legend has it that this was created with lord Rama shot an arrow to get fresh water from the sea to quench his wife Sitaâ€™s thirst. Located about 
                         7 km from the Ramanathaswamy Temple, this place offers some stunningly beautiful and dramatic views of the sea. Incidentally, the place is named Villondi or 'buried bow' as it is believed to be the place where Lord Rama buried his bow and arrow. A long platform leads you to this holy well and it is magical to walk on it as you see the sea from both the sides. The water in the well is quite mysteriously sweet in spite of being surrounded by salt sea water all around and devotees believe it will do them good if they take a sip of this holy water. There is a small temple like structure adjoining this place and as you stand at the edge of the platform, you can see statues of gods and goddesses in the water bed. The sight is quite fascinating, just like the place itself.
