                        The Five falls is one of the nine falls in the Courtallam town. All the nine falls are collectively named as Courtallam falls leading to confusion among tourists. The falls gets its name from the fact that the water flows down in 5 roughly parallel ...

                        The thing that all of these waterfalls had in common was that they apparently had Ayurvedic healing properties since their streams were said to pass through groves of naturally growing herbs with medicinal properties.

                        In fact, I was told that some doctors even recommended bathing in these Ayurvedic waterfalls as treatment.
                        
                        And since we thought India was well-known for producing doctors, maybe they were onto something.here is also a separate bathing place for men and women. Even on weekdays, we could see a fair amount of people. We must take care of them as monkeys are ubiquitous in and around this area.
