The temple with its gold (1500 kg) covering, has intricate work done by artisans specialising in temple art using gold.

                        he layers of pure gold were made and mounted on copper plates by a group of artisans having excellence in the art of using gold. Both the inside and the outside of the vimanam (dome) and the ardha mandapam of Mahalakshmi Temple, in the middle of the Sripuram spiritual park, are covered with pure gold.

                        Tipu and Hyder Mahal, Vellore Overview
Tipu Mahal and Hyder Mahal are two separate castles inside the premises of the Vellore Fort which is located in Vellore city of Tamil Nadu. Although the Vijayanagara Kings built the Vellore Fort and all the other buildings inside it in the 16th Century, Tipu Mahal and Hyder Mahal are known by the names of Tipu Sultan and Hyder Ali who ruled over Mysore in the 18th Century. Both the palaces have undergone decades of climate change and pollution and are currently being looked after by the Archaeological Survey of India.
There are about 180 and over 200 rooms in Tipu Mahal and Hyder Mahal respectively. The exterior of the palaces are constructed in granite with intricate designs and details which reflects the artistry of the craftsmen of that era.
The central pillars in the Tipu Mahal hold the entire structure of the building intact.</p>
