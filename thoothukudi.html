                <h1><b>Thiruchendur Murugan Temple, Tuticorin Overview</b></h1><hr>
                    <p>
                        
                        
                        Thiruchendur Murugan Temple is one of the most esteemed religious places of south India. Located right on the beach of Tuticorin District, it attracts millions of devotees over the year paying respect to the in-house deity of Lord Murugan, the Tamil version of Lord Kartikeya. The temple has a very interesting history rooted in the legend of Lord Murugan's first battle, which was also the purpose of his birth. The temple hosts a number of festivals throughout the year when devotees can make offerings to the god, the most important and popular one being Skanda festival during October-November marking the victory in the battle of Thiruchendur. It is one of the few temples in India which has various forms and avatars of both Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva together. Being located within 200 metres of the sea, it is a miracle that the temple premise is never flooded - not even during the Tsunami.
                        The mighty temple also does social services like running an orphanage, sponsoring education for the needy and 
                        conduction of marriages for the poor at minimal cost.

                <h1><b>Kalugumalai, Tuticorin Overview</b></h1><hr>
                    <p>
                        
A tiny tranquil town in the district of Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu, Kalugumalai or Kazhugumalai is famous for its ancient rock-cut temples and monolithic Jain beds. The city got its name from the hills surrounding it with the same name, which translates to "Hill of Vultures". The hills that surrounding the town gives a unique physical beauty to the whole place. They were earlier known as known as Araimalai or Thirumalai.

The town is divided into two parts Kazhugumalai and South Kazhugumalai or Kottai Kalugumalai and also served as a trade route during the ancient times. According to epigraphies, once upon a time, there was also a palace of the Pandya king 
Ettimannan, here. It is also believed that Kalugumalai was once an important Jain settlement where Lord Mahavir used and preach and worship. 
At the foot of the hills, an urn-burial cemetery was also discovered.

                <h1><b> Our Lady of Snows Basilica, Tuticorin Overview</b></h1><hr>
                    <p>
                        
Our Lady of Snows Basilica is one of the most popular places of worship in Tamil Nadu. It is a shrine dedicated to St. Mary and is inspired from the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.

It is a stunning church and one of the biggest in all of Tamil Nadu. Tales of numerous miracles have been associated with this Church. Made in European Architecture, it takes influences from Rome and Italian styles. One of the most celebrated festivals, Our Lady of Snows Festival is celebrated in Tuticorin when devotees offer prayers and thanks to the Saint. The Saint idol is taken in a golden car all over the city in a procession on August 5, every year. The Basilica itself is a spectacle at that time.
Initially, a modest chapel was built by the Portuguese in Goa and Bombay, soon after they washed ashore safely in spite of a severe tempest. An annual novena is celebrated and draws nearly 5 million pilgrims each year.
