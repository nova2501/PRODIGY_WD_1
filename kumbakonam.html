                        Mahamaham, also known as Mahamagham or Mamangam, is a Hindu festival celebrated every 12 years in the Mahamaham tank located in the city of Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu in the south of India. This 20-acre square tank surrounded by Shiva mandapams is believed by Tamil Hindus to be ancient, and the holy confluence of nine Indian river goddesses: Ganga, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Narmada, Godavari, Krishna, Tungabhadra, Kaveri, and Sarayu, states Diana Eck – a professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies.[1] On the day of the Mahamaham festival, the river goddesses and Shiva gather here to rejuvenate their waters, according
                         to a legend in the Periya Purana.[1] The Hindus consider taking a pilgrimage and holy dip at the Mahamaham tirtha on the day of Mahamaham festival as sacred. The event attracts chariot processions, street fairs and classical dance performances in temple mandapas.

                    <p>    
                        Tiruvidaimarudur has a rich heritage of fertility and people have habit of harvesting thrice in a year. Sometimes the River Cauvery makes a fourth harvest possible..

Tiruvidaimarudur has a Siva Temple namely Mahalingha Swamy with the Goddess Brahath Sundara Gujambal(In Tamil, it is Perunala Mamulai Ammai). Shiva is worshiped as Mahalingeswaraswamy, and is represented by the lingam. This lingam, known as Jothimayalingam is “believed to be the focal point for the seven consorts of Shiva.” [5] The Nandhi in the Temple is one of the largest in the district, of course it is not made of a single stone, that is why it is not weighted more than the Brahdeshwara Temple at Tanjore though it is bigger in size than that. There is a separate Sannathi for "Moogambigai" with Maha Meru.[6] There are 149 inscriptions found in the temple which indicate the “contributions from Pandyas, Cholas, Thanjavur Nayaks and Thanjavur Maratha kingdom.
