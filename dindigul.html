                        Mannavanur Lake is one of the most serene places that you can visit in Kodaikanal trip. This lake, as the name suggest is located in Mannavanur village, which is around 34 km away from Kodaikanal, Dindigul district of Tamilnadu.

                        This picturesque lake can be seen as you drive down to the village. The view of the lake amid the captivating meadows with majestic hills at some distance is worth capturing. The drive to the lake is equally enchanting with eucalyptus and pine trees surrounding the road on both the sides. As you pass across these trees, lush greenery with rich flora and fauna greets you at Mannavanur.
                        
                        This area is bestowed with rich avian fauna. Many birds can be seen flying freely. It is also said that few wild animals can also be spotted once in a while here. As Mannavanur Lake is located inside a sheep farm, flocks of sheep can be seen grazing around the area.

                    <p>
                        
                        The idol of the Muruga in Palani, was created and consecrated by sage Bogar, one of aaseevahamâ€™s (Ancient Tamil Culture) eighteen great siddhas out of an amalgam of nine poisons or navapashanam. The legend also holds that, the sculptor had to work very rapidly to complete its features, but that he spent so much time in creating the face, he did not have time to bestow but a rough grace upon the rest of the body, thus explaining the contrast between the artistic perfection of the face and the slightly less accomplished work upon the body. A shrine to Bhogar exists in the southwestern corridor of the temple, which, by legend, is said to be connected by a subterranean tunnel to a cave in the heart of the hill, where Bhogar continues to meditate and maintain his vigil, with eight idols of Muruga.

                        The deity, after centuries of worship, fell into neglect and was suffered to be engulfed by the forest.
