                <h1><b> Monkey Falls, Coimbatore Overview </b></h1><hr>
                    <p>
                        Monkey Falls comes to the rescue of those people who find peace in the gushing sound of water and feel free when left alone with nature. Situated some 30 km from Pollachi, these famous natural waterfalls of Tamilnadu sit on the road that connects Pollachi and Valparai, a part of the Coimbatore district. Falling from a height of 18 m, travellers love coming here in the monsoon months when the falls start to glimmer not only to photograph the beauty that is imbibed in them but to refresh their soul bathing underneath. As the name suggests, you are bound to find monkeys here. When it comes to how to reach Monkey Falls, you can choose to trek uphill and spot some amazing views on the way. One can also choose to travel to Aliyar Dam,
                         which is quite close to these falls and a popular tourist spot in Tamilnadu.</p>

                <h1><b>   Adiyogi Shiva Statue, Coimbatore Overview</b></h1><hr>
                    <p>
                       
                        Surrounded by verdant green farms at the foothills of Velliangiri Mountains in the Western Ghats, Adiyogi Shiva Statue is the world’s biggest bust statue dedicated to the famous Hindu deity Shiva, which is carved out of 500 tonnes of steel. Located in the Isha Yoga Complex in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, the sculpture stands tall at the height of 112 feet.
                        
                        The Guinness World Book of Records recognised the statue as the “largest bust sculpture” which is 34.3-metre tall excluding plinth, 45 meters long and 7.62 meters wide. Designed by the founder of Isha Foundation- Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, the statue was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the 24th of February, 2017. The sculpture was constructed with the idea to inspire and promote yoga, and the statue is called “Adiyoga” meaning “the first yogi” as Lord Shiva is known to be the originator of yoga

                <h1><b> Velliangiri, Coimbatore Overview </b></h1><hr>
                    <p>    
                      
                        Velliangiri is a place located in the Western Ghats of the western border of the district Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. The area at the foot of this hill Velliangiri is called as Poondi. There is a beautiful temple at this place Poondi, which is facing east with the shrines of Poondi Ganesha, Lord Velliangiri and the Goddess Manonmani. Recently, a 4 1/2 feet tall ivory statue of Nataraja and a statue of 63 Shiva Devotees were consecrated. 

                        To the north of the temple is the Pancha Ganesha Mandapam with five Ganesha statues. Next is the zodiac pillar made of stone and this is something that cannot be found in any other temples. This structure looks like a fully bloomed lotus flower formed by stacking 9 lotus flowers on its central stalk. At the base of this fully bloomed lotus flower are the 12 zodiac signs neatly carved. At the top is an umbrella with a portrait of a beautiful bird on it.
