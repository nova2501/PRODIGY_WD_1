                <h1><b>Namakkal Narasimha Swamy Temple, Namakkal Overview</b></h1><hr>
                    <p>
                        Arulmigu Narasimha Swamy Temple, located in the district of Namakkal of Tamil Nadu, sees tourists coming from all over the state. Scholars believe that the temple was built around the 8th century by the Pandya kings. This is the temple facing which Lord Hanuman stands in a worshipping posture. The temple of Arulmigu Narasimha Swamy is built in the Dravidian style of architecture. The temple is carved out of the hill and is located at the foothills of the Namakkal Fort. The fort itself is another crowd-puller in the town. Every year, a 15-day Panguni Uthiram festival is organised during the month of March-April, when the processional deities are taken out in streets.
                        
                        A spacious pathway of pillared halls leads to the main sanctum where the Lord is seen in a sitting posture, which has earned Him the epithet Asanamurthi. He is seen holding a conch and a chakra.  </p>
